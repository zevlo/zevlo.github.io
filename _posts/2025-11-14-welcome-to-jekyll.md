This is your first blog post written in **markdown**! 🎉

## Why Markdown?

Markdown makes writing content much easier than HTML. You can focus on your ideas instead of worrying about tags.

### Features You Can Use

Here are some things you can do in markdown:

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`
- [Links](https://example.com) with `[text](url)`
- `Inline code` with backticks

### Code Blocks

You can write code blocks like this:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Jekyll!")
    return "Success"
```

### Lists

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Quotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

### Images

You can also add images:

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

## How to Add More Posts

Just create a new file in `_posts/` with the format:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`

Add frontmatter at the top, and write your content in markdown below it!

Happy blogging! 📝
