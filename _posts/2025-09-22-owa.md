In college I studied economics, learning how individuals and organizations allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs. The discipline teaches you to think in systems, to analyze how decisions are made under constraints, and to develop frameworks for evaluating incentive structures and complex problems.

Supporting the Navy's Office of Warfighting Advantage transformed my understanding from theoretical knowledge to operational capability. Theory provides the foundation; experience builds the structure.

## **What is the Office of Warfighting Advantage?**

The Office of Warfighting Advantage (OWA) reports directly to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations with a clear mandate: help the Navy learn faster than its adversaries. In an era of great power competition where numerical superiority is no longer guaranteed, the Navy must rely on the quality of its people, processes, and decision-making to maintain advantage.

The USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain collisions killed 17 Sailors. The USS Bonhomme Richard fire destroyed a $1.2 billion warship. Post-incident investigations showed these weren't isolated technical failures. They exposed systemic cultural problems: communication breakdowns, lack of psychological safety, failure to escalate known issues, and teams treating symptoms instead of root causes.

The Navy needed a systematic approach to organizational learning and continuous improvement, one that was measurable, scalable, and sustainable. OWA developed the Get Real, Get Better (GRGB) framework around a simple premise: Self-Assessment + Self-Correction = Continuous Improvement. Organizations that honestly assess their performance and rapidly correct course will outpace those that cannot.

## **The Framework**

When I started working with OWA, I assumed the tools and techniques would matter most. I expected specific methodologies to be the key to solving organizational problems. Experience proved otherwise. The framework's power comes from foundational principles that guide how tools are applied, not from the tools themselves.

The framework functions as a pyramid. Mindset forms the base, skillset translates principles into behaviors, and toolset represents specific techniques. This structure matters because tools evolve with technology and context while foundational principles remain constant. Master the foundation, and you can apply problem-solving principles across any organizational context.

### **Mindset**

- **Self-Awareness:** The ability to see ourselves clearly and understand how others perceive us. While 95% of people believe they're self-aware, only 10-15% actually are.
- **Psychological Safety:** A shared belief that team members can voice ideas, express concerns, and admit mistakes without fear of punishment.
- **Growth Mindset:** The belief that abilities can be developed through effort. Individuals with this mindset view challenges as learning opportunities and persist through setbacks.
- **Curiosity:** The drive to understand root causes, fueling innovation and adaptability in problem-solving.

### **Skillset**

- **Act Transparently** means actively seeking out performance gaps and creating environments where teams can "find and embrace the red." It's easy to "broadcast the green," to focus only on what's going well. Teams that normalize discussing problems without punishment can fix issues before they become crises.
- **Focus on What Matters Most** means using proven problem-solving methods and spending the majority of time understanding problems before jumping to solutions. Most teams treat symptoms, high-performing teams search for root causes.
- **Build Learning Teams** requires fostering trust, respect, and clear ownership.

### **Toolset**

**Root cause analysis** techniques prevent problems from recurring by identifying and addressing underlying issues rather than surface symptoms. **Driver trees** map cause-and-effect relationships, making complex problems visible and tractable. **Process maps** visualize workflows and identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks in organizational systems.

These tools provide structure to abstract concepts. They give teams systematic methods to work through complex problems. Tools become powerful instruments for change when applied with the proper mindset and skillset. Without this foundation, they devolve into mechanical exercises that fail to drive meaningful organizational improvement.

## **What I Learned**

"Go See, Ask Why, Show Respect." These words from Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho were words my mentor lived by.

When working with Navy Recruiting Command, my mentor gathered everyone with authority to enact change and had them observe how frontline recruiters actually worked. Not what policy prescribed. Not what leadership assumed. The actual work. This practice, known as "going to Gemba," revealed struggle points invisible from conference rooms.

My mentor maintained a bias for action, ensuring improvements within our control were implemented quickly. He didn't allow blame directed at absent personnel. He empowered me to investigate root causes by talking to everyone from frontline recruiters to the Admiral, ensuring each person understood how their tasks connected to the larger system.

Working with Naval Special Warfare, Navy Recruiting Command, and Naval Information Forces, I saw these principles apply across radically different contexts. The framework worked because it's based on universal principles of human learning and organizational behavior. The GRGB framework is a systematic approach to problem-solving that applies anywhere complex organizations need to learn and adapt.
